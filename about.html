        <p>Our Raleigh location is our first and most thriving location! The regulars are really what make this place special. It's almost like taking role call, we can just check them
    off the li! The owner of H-Thai-ML is a huge advocate for work from home, he started his career working through HTML creating websites for thousands of restaurants, studying
    these websites gave him a good idea of starting his own franchise! We strive for every single one of our locations to feel very homely, so when you come in and start your work
    its almost as if you're working from home!</p>
        <p>Here at H-Thai-ML we always had the dream of being the first restaurant on the moon! What better way to enjoy Thai food! Imagine your soup floating right into your mouth! We are super tech-friendly, we love the individuals who come to work on their code, now they don't have to lift their hands from the keyboard to eat! Tired of clicking your spacebar a million times a minute? Take a break and come visit OUR Space Bar!</p>
